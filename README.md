# BioBots Tool

A simple tool for checking BioBot 1 print run statistics.

##Visual Studio

To run this project you will need Visual Studio 2015. You can download it from here: https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/vs-2015-product-editions.aspx.

##JSON Settings

Ensure you have your own JSON file for the tool to run on. Navigate to Controllers/PrintsController.cs, line 15:

<code>
string path = @"C:\Users\onlin\OneDrive\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\BioBots\bioprint-data.json";
</code>

Replace this line with the appropriate path. Also remember to put the JSON file at that location.
